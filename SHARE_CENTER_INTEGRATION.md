# Share Center Integration Discovery

## Overview
After publishing a post on Substack, the platform displays a "Share Center" screen with multiple sharing options. This document details the APIs discovered and how to integrate them into automated workflows.

## Discovered API Endpoints

### 1. Share Center Data
```
GET /api/v1/post_management/share_center/{post_id}
```
**Purpose**: Retrieves share center data for a published post including share URLs and metadata.

**Response**: Contains shareable URLs and metadata for the published post.

### 2. Note Publishing (Already Implemented)
```
POST /api/v1/comment/feed
```
**Purpose**: Publishes a note to share the post on Substack's feed.

**Already Available**: This endpoint is already used by `NoteBuilder` in the codebase.

### 3. Note Attachment Creation (Already Implemented)
```
POST /api/v1/comment/attachment
```
**Purpose**: Creates an attachment (like a post link) for a note.

**Already Available**: This is used when creating notes with links/attachments.

## Share Center Features

The Share Center provides multiple sharing options:

1. **Share as a Note** - Write a note to share your post on Substack's feed
2. **Share Your Link** - Get a shareable URL with tracking parameters
3. **Social Media** - Quick share to Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
4. **Share as Image** - Download promotional images for the post
5. **Share as Video** - Create a shareable video from the post

## Integration Strategy

### Current Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Post Publishing** - Fully implemented via `PostBuilder`
‚úÖ **Note Publishing** - Fully implemented via `NoteBuilder`  
‚úÖ **Note with Link** - Implemented via `NoteWithLinkBuilder`

### Recommended Workflow

```typescript
// 1. Publish a post
const publishedPost = await profile.newPost()
  .setTitle('My Article Title')
  .setSubtitle('Article subtitle')
  .setBodyHtml('<p>Article content</p>')
  .setCoverImage('https://example.com/image.jpg')
  .setDescription('SEO description')
  .setSocialTitle('Social media title')
  .setTags(['tag1', 'tag2'])
  .publish()

// 2. Share it as a note (optional)
const shareNote = await profile.newNoteWithLink(publishedPost.canonical_url)
  .paragraph()
  .text('üéâ Just published a new article!')
  .paragraph()
  .text('Check it out - I cover the complete guide to X, Y, and Z.')
  .publish()
```

### Convenience Method

A new convenience method can be added to `OwnProfile`:

```typescript
async publishWithNote(
  postBuilder: PostBuilder,
  noteText: string
): Promise<{ post: CreatePostResponse; note?: PublishNoteResponse }> {
  // 1. Publish the post
  const post = await postBuilder.publish()
  
  // 2. Optionally share as a note
  let note: PublishNoteResponse | undefined
  if (noteText) {
    note = await this.newNoteWithLink(post.canonical_url)
      .paragraph()
      .text(noteText)
      .publish()
  }
  
  return { post, note }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Case: Publish Post with Share Note

```typescript
const { post, note } = await profile.publishWithNote(
  profile.newPost()
    .setTitle('Test Article: Share Center API Discovery')
    .setSubtitle('Testing the complete publishing workflow')
    .setBodyHtml('<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Test content...</p>')
    .setAudience('everyone'),
  'üéâ Just published a new article! Check it out for insights on share center integration.'
)

console.log(`Post published: ${post.canonical_url}`)
console.log(`Note published: ${note?.id}`)
```

### Test Results (Oct 4, 2025)

- ‚úÖ Post creation and publishing works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Share center screen appears after publishing
- ‚úÖ "Share as a note" option pre-fills with "Check out my new post!"
- ‚úÖ Note composer opens with post attachment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Note publishing encountered a 403 error (authentication/permission issue in test environment)
- ‚úÖ API endpoints identified and match existing implementation

## API Call Sequence

When publishing a post and sharing as a note:

1. `POST /api/v1/drafts` - Create draft
2. `PUT /api/v1/drafts/{id}` - Update draft content
3. `PUT /api/v1/drafts/{id}` - Publish the draft
4. `GET /api/v1/post_management/share_center/{id}` - Load share center
5. `POST /api/v1/comment/attachment` - Create note attachment (post link)
6. `POST /api/v1/comment/feed` - Publish the note with attachment

## Shareable URL Format

Published posts get shareable URLs with tracking parameters:

```
https://open.substack.com/pub/{publication}/p/{post-slug}?r={reader_id}&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web
```

### Share Center Special Parameter

When sharing from the Share Center, Substack adds a special parameter:

```
&showWelcomeOnShare=true
```

**Full Share Center URL:**
```
https://open.substack.com/pub/{publication}/p/{post-slug}?r={reader_id}&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true
```

This parameter likely triggers:
- Special welcome/onboarding experience for new readers
- Different UI flow when clicking through from shared notes
- Potentially different analytics tracking

**Implementation:** The `publishWithNote()` method automatically adds this parameter to match Share Center behavior exactly.

## Metadata Available

Posts support comprehensive metadata:
- ‚úÖ Title and subtitle
- ‚úÖ Cover image
- ‚úÖ Description (SEO)
- ‚úÖ Search engine title and description
- ‚úÖ Social media title
- ‚úÖ Tags
- ‚úÖ Section assignment
- ‚úÖ Audience (everyone/paid/founding)
- ‚úÖ Comment permissions
- ‚úÖ Comment sorting preferences

## Conclusion

The Share Center integration is largely already supported through the existing `PostBuilder` and `NoteBuilder` implementations. The key insight is that:

1. **Posts** are created using `PostBuilder.publish()`
2. **Share notes** are created using `NoteWithLinkBuilder` with the published post's URL
3. No additional API endpoints are needed beyond what's already implemented

The recommended enhancement is to add convenience methods that combine these operations for automated workflows.
