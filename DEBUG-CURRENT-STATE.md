# Debug Current State

## Status Check

‚úÖ **Local SDK Tests:** PASS
- Works perfectly on your machine
- Image uploads to S3
- All features working

‚úÖ **n8n Version Check:** Shows 1.6.0
- Package location: `/usr/lib/node_modules/n8n/node_modules/@b992/substack-api/`
- NOT using `/tmp/sub-api/`

‚ùì **n8n Actual Run:** NEED CURRENT ERROR

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run production workflow in n8n NOW**
2. **Copy the COMPLETE error output**
3. **Check the stack trace path**

---

## What We're Looking For:

**If error shows `/usr/lib/node_modules/.../post-service.js`:**
‚Üí Good! Using correct v1.6.0, but there's a NEW issue

**If error still shows `/tmp/sub-api/`:**
‚Üí n8n didn't restart properly, still using old cached code in memory

**If it WORKS:**
‚Üí Problem solved! üéâ

---

## Possible Scenarios:

### Scenario A: Now it works!
If the version check fixed it, then it was just old code in memory.
Restart solved it.

### Scenario B: New error path but still "fetch failed"
If stack shows `/usr/lib/.../` but still fails, then:
- Could be cookie issue
- Could be network issue  
- Could be Substack API change
- Need to see the FULL error details

### Scenario C: Still old path
If still shows `/tmp/sub-api/`, then n8n wasn't restarted properly.
Need to:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop n8n
sudo systemctl start n8n
```

## Debug Commands for Server:

```bash
# 1. Check what's actually loaded in Node
node -e "console.log(require.resolve('@b992/substack-api'))"

# 2. Check package version
node -e "console.log(require('@b992/substack-api/package.json').version)"

# 3. Check if old folder still exists
ls -la /tmp/sub-api/

# 4. Check n8n process
ps aux | grep n8n

# 5. Restart n8n PROPERLY
sudo systemctl stop n8n
sleep 5
sudo systemctl start n8n
sudo systemctl status n8n
```

## What to Share:

Please run the workflow and share:
1. Complete error output (all logs)
2. Stack trace (especially file paths)
3. Any console.log output from the code
